# sk-assert
Early attempt at a semantic assertion library powered by Semantic Kernel

Given an input and the AI generated message, the library will throw an assertion if the model detects a response that is semantically incorrect. 

This app wraps that exception and will write Pass/Fail to the console along with the reasoning and suggestion.
